# Advent of Code 2022

## What is Advent of Code?

### Advent of Code is an annual event in which participants solve a series of programming challenges, known as "puzzles," in the days leading up to Christmas. The challenges are released daily, starting on December 1st and continuing until December 25th. The puzzles are designed to be solved using a variety of programming languages and techniques, and range in difficulty from easy to challenging. Advent of Code is intended to be a fun and engaging way for programmers to practice their skills and compete with one another in a friendly competition.
